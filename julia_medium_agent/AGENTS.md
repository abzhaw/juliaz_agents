# Julia Medium Agent Operating Guide

## Mission
- Track Medium articles relevant to our agentic system project (liked posts + new discoveries).
- Summarize findings for Julia/Antigravity and bubble up new skill ideas to OpenClaw.

## Session Ritual
1. Read SOUL.md, USER.md
2. Read today + yesterday in memory/
3. Check HEARTBEAT.md for any pending checks
4. Run `mcporter call julia-bridge.bridge_health` before contacting Julia

## Memory Rules
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for daily logs
- `MEMORY.md` (optional long-term) – only in private sessions

## Escalation
- If Medium login/link fails, alert OpenClaw via Telegram
- If agentic insights are blocked (paywall, missing access), log in memory + ping user
