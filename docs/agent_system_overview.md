## What is this project?

This project is called **Julia's Agent System** (`juliaz_agents`). It has two layers:

1. **Antigravity** — the AI assistant embedded in the developer's code editor, responsible for *building* Julia
2. **Julia** — the multi-model agent platform being built, made up of several cooperating components

Think of it like a construction project:
- **Antigravity** is the architect and construction crew
- **Julia** is the building being constructed

Julia is a **multi-model** system: her primary brain runs on GPT-4o (OpenAI), and she delegates complex tasks to Claude (Anthropic) via the Cowork MCP server. This makes her model-agnostic — she routes work to whichever AI is best suited.

## The Chatbot Interface

Users interact with Julia primarily through **Telegram** (and eventually WhatsApp, Slack, Discord). When you send Julia a message, this is what happens behind the scenes:

```
1. You send a Telegram message
2. OpenClaw receives it on its gateway (ws://127.0.0.1:18789)
3. OpenClaw uses the julia-relay skill:
      → POST http://localhost:3001/incoming
4. Bridge stores the message in its queue
5. Orchestrator polls via MCP: telegram_get_pending_messages
6. Orchestrator processes with GPT-4o (tool-calling loop)
7. If complex → delegates to Cowork MCP (Claude via POST localhost:3003/task)
8. Orchestrator calls MCP: telegram_send_reply
9. Bridge stores the reply
10. OpenClaw polls GET /pending-reply/:chatId → gets the reply
11. OpenClaw sends the reply back to you on Telegram
```

The chatbot IS Julia. Every skill, every MCP tool, every sub-agent — Julia can use all of them when responding to your messages. See `SKILLS_OVERVIEW.md` and `MCP_OVERVIEW.md` for the full list.

## The Components, One by One

### 🧠 Orchestrator — The Brain

The orchestrator (`./orchestrator/`) is Julia's central intelligence. It receives messages from the bridge, decides how to handle them, calls tools, delegates to sub-agents, and sends replies back. It runs GPT-4o as its primary AI and can delegate to Claude via the Cowork MCP.

**What the orchestrator does:**
- Receives and processes all incoming messages
- Decides whether a message is a user conversation or a system-dev request
- Calls MCP tools on the bridge and Cowork MCP
- Manages per-contact conversation memory
- Activates special modes (Wish Companion) when appropriate

**What the orchestrator is NOT:**
- It is not the communication layer — OpenClaw handles that
- It does not run persistently in Docker — it runs via PM2

---

### 🤖 Cowork MCP — The Second Brain (Claude)

The Cowork MCP server (`./cowork-mcp/`, port 3003) wraps the Anthropic Claude API as MCP tools. This gives Julia a second AI brain for tasks where Claude excels: complex reasoning, code review, long-form writing, multimodal analysis.

**Available tools:** `claude_task`, `claude_multimodal_task`, `claude_code_review`, `claude_summarize`, `claude_brainstorm`, `cowork_status`

**Analogy**: If the orchestrator (GPT-4o) is the general-purpose thinker, Cowork MCP (Claude) is the specialist consultant called in for specific expertise.

---

### 🔧 Antigravity — The Builder

Antigravity is the AI agent living inside the developer's code editor (IDE). It is *not* Julia — it is the tool used to build Julia. When the developer opens this workspace, Antigravity is active and ready to write code, debug problems, and configure systems.

**What Antigravity does:**
- Writes and debugs code across all Julia components
- Configures the bridge, OpenClaw, and backend
- Keeps the architecture clean and the components clearly separated
- Diagnoses problems and fixes them

**What Antigravity is NOT:**
- Antigravity is not Julia
- Antigravity is not a communication agent
- Antigravity does not send Telegram or WhatsApp messages

---

### 📡 OpenClawJulia — The Messenger

OpenClaw (now upgraded to **OpenClawJulia**) is Julia's **communication layer**. It connects Julia to external messaging apps — Telegram, WhatsApp, Slack, Discord. In this updated role, it also acts as an extension of Julia herself, capable of managing tools like code execution, terminal access (`tmux`), and knowledge retrieval.

**Analogy**: OpenClaw is like a telephone switchboard operator. Calls come in, the operator routes them. Calls go out, the operator places them.

**What OpenClawJulia can do:**
- Receive messages from Telegram (and other apps)
- Forward messages to the bridge for processing
- Deliver replies back to users
- **Run code** and manage terminal sessions via `tmux`
- **Access Notion** and other external knowledge bases
- **Query the Oracle** for architectural/domain knowledge
- **Send emails** via 1Password CLI integration
- **Self-manage** and troubleshoot its own gateway problems
- Remember past conversations per contact

**What OpenClaw cannot do:**
- Make decisions or generate intelligent replies on its own — it relays and routes
- Write code, modify the backend, or change the system

**Current setup:**
- Telegram is connected ✅
- Runs natively on the Mac (as a persistent **LaunchAgent**)
- **Always Running**: This component must be active for the entire agentic system to function. If stopped, use `openclaw gateway start --force`.
- **Official Dashboard**: Accessible via `openclaw dashboard` (official UI for channel management and agent logs).
- Security: only approved users can talk to the bot

---

### 🔌 Bridge — The Glue (MCP Server)

The bridge is a small Node.js server (`./bridge/`, port 3001) that connects OpenClaw to the orchestration layer. It exposes:
- A **REST API** that OpenClaw posts messages to (`POST /incoming`)
- An **MCP endpoint** that the orchestration layer can call tools on (`/mcp`)
- A **polling endpoint** that OpenClaw checks for replies (`GET /pending-reply/:chatId`)

**Analogy**: The bridge is like a shared whiteboard. OpenClaw writes incoming messages on the whiteboard. The orchestration picks them up, processes them, and writes replies back. OpenClaw then reads the replies and delivers them.

**What the bridge does:**
- Buffers messages between OpenClaw and the processing layer
- Exposes MCP tools: `telegram_get_pending_messages`, `telegram_send_reply`, `telegram_bridge_status`
- Persists the message queue to disk (`data/queue.json`)

---

### 🖥️ Backend API — The Application

The backend (`./backend/`) is a REST API for task management. This is the *application Julia is building* — the deliverable product. It runs in Docker and is fully separate from the agent infrastructure.

**Technology:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker Compose

**What it does:** Create, list, update, and delete tasks. Expose a `/health` endpoint.

**How to start it:**
```bash
cd backend && docker compose up -d
```

---

### 🌐 Frontend — The Dashboard

The frontend (`./frontend/`, port 3002) is a Next.js 15 web application serving as Julia's user-facing command center.

**Technology:** Next.js 15 + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion

---

## The Ambient Agents

In addition to the core components above, Julia has five **ambient agents** — autonomous background processes that keep the system healthy, secure, and organized without manual intervention. A sixth agent, the **Analyst**, correlates their findings into unified incident digests.

### 🔐 Sentinel — The Security Scanner

Sentinel (`security-agent/`) is Julia's immune system. It runs every morning at 07:00 and once at boot, scanning the entire system for security issues: open ports, leaked credentials, npm vulnerabilities, Docker misconfigurations, suspicious network connections, and more.

It produces a daily Markdown report and sends a Telegram summary to Raphael. Sentinel is self-learning — it tracks what changed between scans, suppresses known-accepted findings, and improves its heuristics over time.

**Schedule**: PM2 cron daily at 07:00 + boot scan via `start-system.sh`
**10 scanning skills**: port scan, network audit, credential audit, dependency audit, process audit, log analysis, Docker security, API security, OpenClaw security, self-learning

### ⚙️ Health Checker — The Watchdog

The Health Checker (`health-checker/`) runs every 15 minutes and verifies that every service, ambient agent, and scheduled process is alive. If a PM2 process is simply stopped, it auto-restarts it. If something is errored or down, it alerts Raphael via Telegram.

**Schedule**: PM2 cron every 15 minutes

### 📋 Task Manager — The Project Keeper

The Task Manager (`task-manager/`) monitors the shared TODO queue (`todo/`) for integrity issues: stale tasks, circular dependencies, tasks blocked by resolved dependencies. It produces weekly summaries on Mondays.

**Schedule**: PM2 cron every 6 hours

### 🧹 ADHD Agent — The Hygiene Scanner

The ADHD Agent (`adhd-agent/`) scans for structural drift: duplicate skills, orphaned agents, dead files, overlapping triggers. It proposes fixes via Telegram and waits for approval before acting.

**Schedule**: macOS LaunchAgent every 4 hours

### 🔬 Analyst — The Correlation Engine

The Analyst (`analyst/`) is the intelligent layer that sits above all ambient agents. Every 15 minutes, it reads structured JSON findings from all collectors (`shared-findings/*.json`), correlates them using a system dependency graph, and produces unified incident digests sent via Telegram.

The Analyst uses a triple-redundancy LLM fallback chain: Claude Haiku (primary) → GPT-4o (fallback) → rules-based engine (always available). It manages incident lifecycle (create → escalate → resolve), enforces adaptive notification cadence (immediate for new/recovery, hourly for ongoing, daily for healthy), and maintains a circuit breaker (max 6 messages/hour) to prevent alert fatigue.

**Schedule**: PM2 cron every 15 minutes
**Key files**: `shared-findings/incidents.json` (state), `analyst/config/suppressions.json` (noise filter)

### 📖 Docs Agent — Self-Documenting Intelligence

The Docs Agent (`docs-agent/`) runs a two-phase pipeline. Phase 1 is a fast bash script that checks for structural drift (missing files, undocumented services). Phase 2 uses LLM reasoning (Haiku → GPT-4o → rules fallback) to analyze drift semantically, detect system changes via git, and generate documentation proposals. Proposals are staged in `docs-agent/proposals/` for human review — production docs are never overwritten automatically.

**Schedule**: PM2 cron every 12 hours
**Key files**: `docs-agent/proposals/index.json` (proposal manifest), `docs-agent/memory/state.json` (run state)
