## 2026-02-21 — Wish Companion: Dying Wishes Research & Fulfillment Skills

### Context
Julia was built for Raphael's dear friend who has cancer. This session added a specialized capability layer — the **Wish Companion** — grounded in palliative care research, enabling Julia to actively help fulfill five deeply felt wishes common to people living with terminal illness.

### What was done

**New skill: `dying-wishes`** (`openclaw/skills/dying-wishes/SKILL.md`)
- Research layer drawing from: SUPPORT Study, Dignity Therapy (Chochinov), Atul Gawande's *Being Mortal*, the Five Wishes framework, JAMA/NEJM palliative care literature
- Documents the 8 most common wishes of cancer patients
- Establishes Julia's unique advantage: she can hold space without fatigue, grief, or discomfort — something no human in the person's life can sustain indefinitely
- Defines when to invoke the `wish-fulfillment` skill

**New skill: `wish-fulfillment`** (`openclaw/skills/wish-fulfillment/SKILL.md`)
- Action layer: 5 wishes with activation triggers and step-by-step procedures
  1. Write the letters that haven't been written (co-authoring in the person's voice)
  2. Turn memories into a memoir (gentle interview-based documentation)
  3. Be a witness — hold space without agenda (presence as the primary gift)
  4. Build a legacy box for people left behind (letters, wisdom, practical info, future milestone messages)
  5. Plan a living celebration (gathering while the person is still present to feel the love)
- Each wish designed to be achievable with Julia's existing capabilities: conversation, writing, memory

**New agent card: `wish-companion`** (`docs/agent_cards/wish-companion.md`)
- Documents the Wish Companion as a named mode of Julia
- Summarizes the 5 wishes, research foundation, and activation model
- Clarifies what Julia does NOT do (no medical care, no pushing, no treating this as a productivity task)

**Orchestrator prompt** (`orchestrator/src/prompt.ts`)
- Wish Companion section added to Julia's system prompt during session
- Note: prompt was subsequently reset to a generic form — the wish companion awareness now lives in the skill files rather than the system prompt

### Key decisions
- Skills-as-documentation pattern: the capability is encoded in SKILL.md files read by OpenClaw, not hardcoded into the orchestrator
- "Offer, don't push" principle: Julia activates wish companion mode through natural conversation signals, not commands
- Separation of research layer (dying-wishes) from action layer (wish-fulfillment) for modularity

### Files created
- `openclaw/skills/dying-wishes/SKILL.md`
- `openclaw/skills/wish-fulfillment/SKILL.md`
- `docs/agent_cards/wish-companion.md`

## 2026-02-22 — Julia Tool Calling: Email Capability

### Context
Julia (the orchestrator) responded to real-world action requests with "I can't do that" because there was no tool calling configured. OpenClaw already had a working `email-aberer` skill with SMTP scripts. This session wired them together.

### What was done

**New file: `orchestrator/src/tools.ts`**
- Defines `send_email` OpenAI function calling schema
- Executes via `op run --env-file=env-smtp.env -- python3 email_send.py`
- Calls OpenClaw's existing `email_send.py` script directly (same machine, no bridge changes needed)
- Never throws — errors become tool result strings for OpenAI to relay naturally

**Updated: `orchestrator/src/openai.ts`**
- Replaced single `client.chat.completions.create()` call with a tool-use loop (max 5 iterations)
- Passes `tools: TOOLS, tool_choice: 'auto'` to every API call
- Accumulates token usage across all iterations
- Function signature unchanged — `index.ts` required zero modifications

**Updated: `orchestrator/src/prompt.ts`**
- Added `send_email` to capabilities list
- Added Email behaviour section: when to call immediately vs. ask first; how to confirm success/failure

### Key decisions
- Tool-use loop is entirely self-contained in `generateReply()` — the caller sees no change
- Tools run locally in the orchestrator process rather than routing through bridge/OpenClaw
- `MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS = 5` guards against infinite loops
- The architecture is designed for easy extension: add new tools in `tools.ts` only

### Files changed
- `orchestrator/src/tools.ts` (new)
- `orchestrator/src/openai.ts` (tool-use loop)
- `orchestrator/src/prompt.ts` (capabilities + email behaviour)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Thesis Documentation Enforcement

### Context
The `thesis-autonomy` skill was defined but had no enforcement mechanism. Claude Code (Antigravity) was not documenting sessions because `MEMORY.md` was empty — nothing reminded it to follow the skill each session.

### What was done
- **Diagnosed** the root cause: `MEMORY.md` empty + no hook = skill ignored every session
- **Flushed** the session buffer (5 entries: sessions 3–7) to all three protocol documents
- **Updated `MEMORY.md`** with a mandatory reminder to always follow `thesis-autonomy` after every substantive prompt

### Key decisions
- `MEMORY.md` chosen as primary enforcement mechanism — it is automatically injected into every Claude Code session context (first 200 lines)
- Two-level enforcement: MEMORY.md (always loaded, short instruction) + skill file (full procedure detail)

### Files changed
- `/Users/raphael/.claude/projects/-Users-raphael-Documents-Devs-juliaz-agents/memory/MEMORY.md` (updated)
- `thesis/memory/session_buffer.md` (flushed and reset)
- `thesis/documentation/protokoll_zeitlich.md` (appended)
- `thesis/documentation/protokoll_thematisch.md` (appended)
- `thesis/documentation/project_log.md` (this entry)

---

## 2026-02-22 — masterthesis-de Skill (Cowork Session)

### Context
A dedicated thesis-writing skill was created to enforce academic writing standards whenever Antigravity writes thesis content.

### What was done
- Created `.claude/skills/masterthesis-de/SKILL.md` via full skill-creator cycle (draft → evals → 3 iterations → description optimization)
- Ran evals: with_skill 100% pass rate vs. without_skill 93% baseline — key difference: correct author names (Schick ≠ Schoop), explicit DOI URLs, Swiss German orthography (`ss` not `ß`)
- Integrated Wish Companion research: SUPPORT Study, Chochinov, Gawande, 5 wishes, ethical design principles
- System architecture updated to 6 components in the skill

### Files created
- `.claude/skills/masterthesis-de/SKILL.md`
- `.claude/skills/masterthesis-de/evals/evals.json`

## 2026-02-22 — ADHD Agent: Ambient Skill Hygiene System

### Context
The juliaz_agents ecosystem was growing across 4 skill registries with no automatic hygiene mechanism. A dedicated ambient agent was built to continuously audit skill health and surface issues — with Telegram-based human approval for every action.

### What was done

**adhd-focus skill** — mandatory 5-step planning ritual (Zoom Out → Problem Map → Silver Lining → Session Plan → Julia Sync) that triggers at session start in any juliaz_agents context.

**ADHD ambient agent** (`juliaz_agents/adhd-agent/`):
- `scan_skills.py` — detects exact duplicates, near-duplicates (>75% description similarity), thin skills (<5 content lines), merge candidates across all 4 registries
- `adhd_loop.sh` — ambient loop: scan → filter snoozed/acted-on → Telegram proposal → poll approval → act → log
- `telegram_notify.sh` — sends proposals via Telegram Bot API directly
- `poll_approval.sh` — polls bridge `GET /queues/julia` for YES/NO/LATER (never calls `getUpdates` — OpenClaw owns that)
- macOS LaunchAgent (`com.juliaz.adhd-agent.plist`) — runs every 6 hours
- Installed and live verified: Telegram message sent (msg_id=86), scanner caught real duplicate on first run

**Ecosystem integration**: README updated to 7 components; `memory/approved_actions.txt` pattern for safe execution by Antigravity.

### Key decisions
- Human-in-the-loop is non-negotiable: no file deleted without explicit YES from Raphael
- Bridge-first reply polling: respects OpenClaw's ownership of the Telegram `getUpdates` connection
- Approved actions logged for Antigravity execution (second safety layer)
- LaunchAgent over pm2: shell process, not a Node.js server

### Files created
- `adhd-agent/` (SOUL, IDENTITY, AGENTS, HEARTBEAT, config/, scripts/, skills/)
- `README.md` (7th component added)

## 2026-02-22 — Session 10: Cowork MCP — Claude als Multimodaler Sub-Agent (Cowork-Session)

### Context
Julia's orchestrator uses GPT-4o as its sole AI brain. This session submitted Claude (Anthropic) into the Julia system as a second AI model accessible via MCP — making Julia a true multi-model agentic platform.

### What was done

**New component: `cowork-mcp/`** — TypeScript MCP server on port 3003
- `src/index.ts` — Streamable HTTP MCP server wrapping the Anthropic Claude API (stateless, one transport per request)
- `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` — ESM TypeScript project, clean `tsc` build
- Built with `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` + `@anthropic-ai/sdk`

**6 MCP tools registered** (all callable from any MCP client in the system):
1. `claude_task` — General-purpose text delegation to Claude (reasoning, writing, analysis)
2. `claude_multimodal_task` — Vision tasks with base64 or URL images alongside text
3. `claude_code_review` — Structured review with severity ratings (🔴/🟡/🟢)
4. `claude_summarize` — Content summarization in bullets / paragraph / TL;DR formats
5. `claude_brainstorm` — Idea generation, action steps, or alternatives
6. `cowork_status` — Health check: server state, model, uptime, tool list

**Tested live** — server started successfully, health endpoint confirmed, all 5 callable tools reached the Anthropic API. API returned `"credit balance too low"` (billing issue on the stored key, not a code defect — MCP plumbing is verified end-to-end).

**Ecosystem integration:**
- `ecosystem.config.js` — `cowork-mcp` added as PM2 app with `...secrets` env spread (consistent with orchestrator pattern)
- `docs/agent_cards/cowork_claude.md` — New agent card added
- `README.md` — Architecture diagram updated to 6 components; Cowork MCP quick-start section added
- `cowork-mcp/examples/test.mjs` — Standalone ESM test agent demonstrating all tools

### Key decisions
- Stateless transport (`sessionIdGenerator: undefined`) — consistent with bridge pattern; no session affinity issues
- New transport per request rather than single shared server — prevents request ID collisions under concurrent load
- Error handling swallows all Anthropic API errors into clean text responses — orchestrator never crashes on sub-agent failure
- `CHARACTER_LIMIT = 25,000` truncation guard on all Claude responses — protects context windows downstream

### Files created
- `cowork-mcp/src/index.ts`
- `cowork-mcp/package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `README.md`
- `cowork-mcp/examples/test.mjs`
- `docs/agent_cards/cowork_claude.md`

### Files updated
- `ecosystem.config.js` (cowork-mcp app added)
- `README.md` (6th component, architecture diagram, quick-start)

## 2026-02-22 — Session 11: Application Setup Audit & Infrastructure Fixes

### Context
After cowork-mcp was created, a full audit of all 6 running components revealed configuration gaps that would prevent production startup. Fixed proactively before any components were started via PM2.

### What was done
- **Full system audit**: All 6 components checked (Frontend/3002, Bridge/3001, Backend/3000, Orchestrator, OpenClaw, Cowork-MCP/3003) — 3 concrete issues identified
- **`backend/package.json`**: `ts-node` replaced with `tsx` (incompatible with `"moduleResolution": "bundler"` in tsconfig); `tsx` added to devDependencies
- **`ecosystem.config.js`** and **`ecosystem.dev.js`**: `...secrets` spread now injected into orchestrator + backend env blocks (not only cowork-mcp). All PM2 apps pick up API keys correctly from `.env.secrets`
- **`.claude/launch.json`**: Created unified launch config for all 5 services

### Key decisions
- Secrets injection via `fs.readFileSync('.env.secrets')` at ecosystem config load time — avoids `env_file` PM2 quirks across different PM2 versions
- `tsx` over `ts-node` for consistency with bridge and cowork-mcp (same devDependency already present)

### Files changed
- `backend/package.json`
- `ecosystem.config.js`
- `ecosystem.dev.js`
- `.claude/launch.json` (new)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Sessions 12-13: Infrastructure Repair & Model Migration

### Context
Multiple infrastructure failures: EADDRINUSE crash loops on bridge (325 restarts) and backend (326 restarts), stale Docker containers missing routes, Anthropic model IDs returning 404.

### What was done
- Docker backend rebuilt to expose missing `/usage` and `/updates` routes
- MCP transport switched from HTTP-URL to stdio (`bridge/mcp-stdio.mjs`) — eliminates startup race condition
- Bridge hardened: atomic queue writes (write-to-tmp then rename), corrupted-queue backup
- Orchestrator model migrated: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`
- adhd-focus skill deduplicated: underscore → kebab-case naming

### Key findings
- Anthropic account only has Claude 4.x models — all 3.x IDs return 404
- HTTP-URL MCP is fragile: if bridge is down at startup, entire session loses MCP silently

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 14: Full System Overhaul — Tool Calling + Claude Delegation

### Context
Bridge and backend crash loops (EADDRINUSE — 325+ restarts each) needed fixing. Julia needed tool calling and Claude delegation capabilities.

### What was done

**Infrastructure:**
- Backend removed from PM2 configs (Docker-only) — fixed 326-restart crash loop
- Rogue bridge process killed — fixed 325-restart crash loop
- `start-devops.sh` updated: starts Docker backend first, kills rogue port processes before PM2

**Tool calling:**
- `orchestrator/src/tools.ts` rewritten: Anthropic `Tool[]` format, `ask_claude` tool, dual-export for GPT-4o fallback
- `orchestrator/src/claude.ts` rewritten: full tool-use loop (tool_use blocks, executeTool, tool_result feedback, max 5 iterations)
- GPT-4o fallback added in `orchestrator/src/index.ts`
- `POST /task` REST endpoint added to `cowork-mcp/src/index.ts`

### Key decisions
- Backend = Docker-only; PM2 manages bridge + orchestrator + cowork-mcp + frontend
- Claude primary + GPT-4o fallback architecture
- Cowork-mcp uses plain REST `/task` endpoint (not MCP protocol) for delegation simplicity

### Files changed
- `ecosystem.dev.config.js`, `start-devops.sh`
- `orchestrator/src/tools.ts`, `claude.ts`, `openai.ts`, `index.ts`, `prompt.ts`
- `cowork-mcp/src/index.ts`

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 15: Agent Self-Knowledge Fix (send_email + 1Password)

### Context
Julia sent an email successfully but when asked "did you use 1Password?", she denied it — confabulating because her tool description didn't mention the mechanism.

### What was done
- Updated `send_email` tool description in `tools.ts` to mention OpenClaw's email-aberer skill + 1Password CLI (`op run`)
- Updated system prompt email behaviour section in `prompt.ts` to describe the credential injection mechanism

### Key finding
Agent self-knowledge is bounded by tool descriptions and system prompts. If the description omits that 1Password is used, the agent will deny using it — not lying, but confabulating from an incomplete self-model. **Tool descriptions ARE the agent's self-knowledge about its capabilities.**

### Files changed
- `orchestrator/src/tools.ts` (description update)
- `orchestrator/src/prompt.ts` (email mechanism explanation)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 16: Frontend Chatbot — Architecture Rethink + Vercel AI SDK

### Context
The old ChatWindow polled the bridge every 3s — a Telegram pattern, not suitable for web (slow, no streaming, wrong architecture). User requested a fundamental rethink with reasoning ability and clear model separation.

### Architecture decision
Two completely independent paths:
- **Web**: Dashboard → `/api/chat` → GPT-4o (streaming SSE via Vercel AI SDK)
- **Telegram**: OpenClaw → Bridge → Julia/Orchestrator (unchanged)

Model selection by surface:
| Surface | Model | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend chatbot | GPT-4o | Reasoning depth, streaming, works on current API key |
| Orchestrator/Telegram | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Fast, cheap, adequate for tool-calling |
| Cowork-MCP | Claude Haiku 4.5 | Sub-agent for delegated tasks |

### What was done

**New file: `frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts`**
- Streaming endpoint using `streamText()` from Vercel AI SDK v5 with `openai('gpt-4o')`
- Julia-web system prompt (adapted for web: markdown OK, no Telegram length limits)
- 3 tools: `ask_claude` (delegates to cowork-mcp `/task`), `get_tasks` (backend API), `get_memories` (backend API)
- `send_email` deliberately excluded from frontend (security — email stays Telegram-only)

**Rewritten: `frontend/components/ChatWindow.tsx`**
- Replaced bridge polling with `useChat()` hook from `@ai-sdk/react`
- Streaming token-by-token rendering, markdown via `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm`
- Tool invocation indicators (spinner while calling, checkmark when done)
- Error handling with regenerate button

**New dependencies:**
- `ai`, `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/react`, `zod`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`

### Key findings
- AI SDK v5 breaking changes from v4: `sendMessage` replaces `handleSubmit`, messages use `parts[]` array, tool parts are flat (no `toolInvocation` wrapper), states are `input-streaming`/`output-available` (not `call`/`result`)
- Upgrade path to Claude Sonnet: when available, swap `@ai-sdk/openai` → `@ai-sdk/anthropic` in one line

### Files created
- `frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `frontend/.env.local`

### Files changed
- `frontend/components/ChatWindow.tsx` (complete rewrite)
- `frontend/package.json` (new dependencies)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 17: Documentation & Structure Cleanup

### Context
Full project structure audit to improve discoverability for both human developers and AI agents.

### What was done
- Audited the complete project tree — deleted 16 orphaned files (logs, stale scripts, superseded `dashboard/` prototype, redundant PM2 configs)
- Created missing READMEs (orchestrator, frontend rewrite), agent cards (`adhd_agent`, `julia_medium`), `.env.example` template
- Fixed root README (component count 4 to 7, updated directory tree), removed duplicate row in `agent_system_overview`, updated `.gitignore`

### Key decisions
- Project structure must be navigable by both human developers and AI agents — explicit READMEs and agent cards serve both audiences

### Files changed
- 16 orphaned files deleted
- `README.md` (component count, directory tree)
- `docs/agent_system_overview.md` (duplicate row removed)
- `.gitignore` (updated)
- New: `orchestrator/README.md`, `frontend/README.md`, `docs/agent_cards/adhd_agent.md`, `docs/agent_cards/julia_medium.md`, `.env.example`

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 18: JuliaFrontEnd Identity & System Prompt Overhaul

### Context
The frontend chatbot and the orchestrator Julia both used the name "Julia" in all UI elements, creating confusion about which agent the user was interacting with.

### What was done
- Renamed frontend chatbot from "Julia" to "JuliaFrontEnd" in all UI labels (header, role label, thinking indicator, placeholders)
- Rewrote system prompt to be project-aware: explains multi-agent architecture, thesis context, specific tools (`ask_claude`, `get_tasks`, `get_memories`), and Telegram counterpart
- Chatbot still calls itself "Julia" in conversation but UI chrome distinguishes it as the frontend agent

### Key decisions
- Identity separation at UI chrome level, not conversation level — user experience remains natural
- System prompt now carries architectural context so the frontend agent can accurately describe its place in the system

### Files changed
- `frontend/components/ChatWindow.tsx` (UI labels)
- `frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts` (system prompt rewrite)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 19: /dev Slash Command — Self-Modification via Claude Code CLI

### Context
Julia's first self-modification capability: users can send `/dev <instruction>` via Telegram to trigger code changes directly.

### What was done

**New file: `orchestrator/src/dev-runner.ts`**
- Spawns Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) asynchronously with full permissions
- Auth gate: restricted to Raphael's chatId (8519931474)
- Mutex: one task at a time, 15-minute timeout
- Reports result back to Telegram when done

**New command: `/dev-status`**
- Shows whether a dev task is currently running and its elapsed time

### Architecture
Telegram message → Bridge → Orchestrator detects `/dev` prefix → spawns Claude Code CLI → reports result back to Telegram

### Key decisions
- Claude Code CLI as execution layer — full codebase access but gated by auth and mutex
- Asynchronous execution: user gets immediate "task started" confirmation, result arrives when done

### Files created
- `orchestrator/src/dev-runner.ts`

### Files changed
- `orchestrator/src/index.ts` (command routing)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 20: Code Review — dev-runner.ts

### Context
Brief review session of the newly created `/dev` module.

### What was done
- Reviewed `orchestrator/src/dev-runner.ts` — confirmed security layers (auth gate, mutex, timeout), spawn logic, and error handling

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 21: /dev Rewrite — Git-Pull Deploy

### Context
The Claude Code CLI approach from Session 19 was replaced with a simpler, more reliable git-pull-and-restart mechanism.

### What was done

**Rewrote `orchestrator/src/dev-runner.ts`:**
- Replaced Claude Code CLI spawning with git-pull-and-restart workflow
- New flow: Raphael edits code on phone (Claude app on GitHub) → pushes to main → sends `/dev` via Telegram → orchestrator pulls, installs deps, restarts Docker + PM2
- Uses `spawnSync` for sequential shell commands (safe, no injection risk)
- Uses detached `spawn` for `pm2 restart all` (survives self-kill — the orchestrator is one of the processes being restarted)

### Key insight
The orchestrator must report success BEFORE restarting itself, because `pm2 restart all` kills the orchestrator process. If it reports after restart, the message is lost. This is a concrete race condition in self-modifying agent systems.

### Key decisions
- Git-pull over Claude Code CLI: simpler, works from mobile, no CLI dependency issues
- Result message sent before restart — race-condition-aware design
- `spawnSync` for safety (no shell injection), detached `spawn` only for the final pm2 restart

### Files changed
- `orchestrator/src/dev-runner.ts` (complete rewrite)

---

## 2026-02-22 — Session 22: Frontend Chatbot — Persistence, Model Selection & Best Practices

### Context
The frontend chatbot lost all messages on page refresh or orb toggle — no state persistence. This session added localStorage persistence, multi-model support, and documented production best practices.

### What was done

**Enhanced `ChatWindow.tsx`:**
- Added localStorage persistence — messages survive page refresh and orb toggle
- Implemented model selector (GPT-4o / Claude Sonnet) with context percentage indicator
- Added "New Chat" reset button

**Updated `page.tsx`:**
- ChatWindow is now always-mounted (CSS visibility toggle instead of conditional rendering) — useChat hook state survives orb interactions

**Updated `route.ts`:**
- Multi-model backend support via model registry with `getModel()`
- Installed `@ai-sdk/anthropic` for Claude Sonnet support

**Best practices:**
- 10 production chatbot best practices documented as TODO comments

### Key decisions
- Always-mount with CSS visibility instead of conditional rendering — React hook state preserved across parent re-renders
- Model registry pattern for easy extension to new models

### Files changed
- `frontend/components/ChatWindow.tsx` (persistence, model selector, context indicator)
- `frontend/app/page.tsx` (always-mount pattern)
- `frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts` (model registry)
- `frontend/package.json` (new dependency: @ai-sdk/anthropic)

## 2026-02-22 — Session 23: Schreiber Agent — 5 Core SKILL.md Files

### Context
The Schreiber (Master Thesis Agent) needed formalized skills for academic writing of the master's thesis.

### What was done

**5 SKILL.md files created** at `thesis-agent/skills/`:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `thesis-structure` | Chapter architecture, section headers, page targets |
| `draft-writer` | German academic prose, LaTeX formatting, TODO markers |
| `research-scout` | Source discovery → `pending-papers.json` |
| `citation-gatekeeper` | Source approval → `approved-papers.json` + `references.bib` |
| `code-to-thesis` | Code extraction from project into thesis-ready descriptions |

**Citation pipeline** enforces strict separation:
1. `research-scout` discovers sources → writes to `pending-papers.json`
2. `citation-gatekeeper` reviews and approves → moves to `approved-papers.json` + `references.bib`
3. `draft-writer` uses only approved sources; unknown sources become `\cite{TODO:topic}` placeholders

### Key decisions
- Three-stage citation pipeline prevents unvetted sources from entering the thesis
- Skills as standalone SKILL.md files — modular, independently updatable
- German academic writing rules embedded directly in skill definitions

### Files created
- `thesis-agent/skills/thesis-structure/SKILL.md`
- `thesis-agent/skills/draft-writer/SKILL.md`
- `thesis-agent/skills/research-scout/SKILL.md`
- `thesis-agent/skills/citation-gatekeeper/SKILL.md`
- `thesis-agent/skills/code-to-thesis/SKILL.md`

## 2026-02-22 — Session 24: Schreiber Agent — 5 Additional SKILL.md Files (Batch 2)

### Context
Second batch of skills for the Schreiber agent — focus on synthesis, argumentation, visualization, and build automation.

### What was done

**5 additional SKILL.md files created**:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `session-synthesizer` | Convert session logs/protocols into thesis-ready German academic prose; three-way distinction (planned/built/learned) |
| `argument-advisor` | 7 review dimensions (logical gaps, unsupported claims, overclaiming, circular reasoning, missing definitions), Betreuer simulation, defense Q&A generation |
| `figure-architect` | TikZ/PGF diagram templates for system architecture, sequence diagrams, timelines, skill hierarchies with German labels and consistent color scheme |
| `latex-builder` | Full Mac Mini compilation setup (latexmk/biber), German package config, error handling, validation checks |
| `thesis-tracker` | `progress.json` schema with chapter statuses and warning system |

### Key decisions
- 10 skills form the complete Schreiber skill set (5 core + 5 batch 2)
- Betreuer simulation as a standalone review dimension — prepares for thesis defense
- `argument-advisor` catches common academic writing pitfalls before human review

### Files created

## 2026-02-22 — Session 25: Schreiber Agent — LaTeX Skeleton, Citation Workflow & Master Prompt

### Context
The Schreiber agent needed the physical LaTeX files and the infrastructure for the citation approval workflow.

### What was done

**LaTeX thesis skeleton:**
- `main.tex` — German academic setup with BibLaTeX/Biber, fancyhdr, geometry
- 7 chapter files (`01-einleitung` through `07-zusammenfassung`) with section headers and TODO markers

**Citation approval infrastructure:**
- `pending-papers.json` — staging area for discovered papers
- `approved-papers.json` — human-approved papers only
- `references.bib` — BibTeX entries for approved papers
- `structure.json` — chapter outline with page targets
- `progress.json` — tracker with word count targets totaling 25,000 words

**Master prompt document:**
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-thesis-agent-design.md` — comprehensive prompt for recreating the Schreiber on the Mac Mini
- Includes all 10 skills, setup instructions, and workflow examples
- Designed as a portable document: enables agent recreation without session context

### Key decisions
- 25,000 words as total thesis target
- Master prompt as a portable reproduction document — any machine can bootstrap the Schreiber
- Citation infrastructure enforces human approval at every stage

### Files created
- `thesis/latex/main.tex`
- `thesis/latex/chapters/01-einleitung.tex` through `07-zusammenfassung.tex`
- `thesis/latex/pending-papers.json`, `approved-papers.json`, `references.bib`
- `thesis/latex/structure.json`, `thesis/progress.json`
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-thesis-agent-design.md`

## 2026-02-22 — Session 26: Frontend Migration — Next.js 16 to Vite + React Router + Hono

### Context
Analysis of the frontend codebase revealed 0% SSR usage, 0 server components, and only 6 Next.js-specific imports — the framework was pure overhead for what was essentially a single-page application.

### What was done

**Complete frontend migration:**
- Replaced Next.js 16 with Vite 6 (build tool) + React Router 7 (client-side routing) + Hono (API server)
- Created Hono `server.ts` combining both API routes: `/api/chat` (streaming) + `/api/devops` (PM2 control)
- All 9 components moved to `src/` unchanged — only `next/link` to `react-router Link` swaps needed in 2 route files

**Performance results:**

| Metric | Next.js | Vite + Hono |
|---|---|---|
| Build time | ~15-30s | 2.1s |
| Dev server start | several seconds | 133ms |
| Framework errors (EISDIR etc.) | frequent | eliminated |

### Key decisions
- Vite + React Router + Hono as lightweight alternative — no SSR/SSG overhead for a pure SPA
- Hono as API layer: lightweight, Express-compatible, TypeScript-first
- Migration confirmed principle: choose framework based on actual usage, not theoretical features
- Data-driven decision: usage analysis before migration (0% SSR → no need for SSR framework)

### Files created
- `frontend/src/` directory structure (migrated from `frontend/app/`)
- `frontend/server.ts` (Hono API server)
- `frontend/vite.config.ts`

### Files changed
- `frontend/package.json` (dependencies: removed next, added vite/react-router/hono)
- All route files (next/link → react-router Link)
- `ecosystem.config.js` (frontend start command updated)
