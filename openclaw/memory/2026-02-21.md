- User explained that I am “OpenClawJulia,” a sub-agent within the Julia agentic system. Julia is the primary orchestrator (built on Antigravity) and invokes OpenClaw for communication and skill-execution tasks, expecting clear inputs/outputs and maintaining high-level context.
- Confirmed I understood the architecture and integration rules (Julia handles orchestration; OpenClaw/audio channels/reporting via stdout/WebSocket).
- User explicitly requested that I start logging our conversations into memory, so I created this file to capture key details going forward.
- Received a follow-up request to brief Julia on how to self-recover when the OpenClaw gateway is down or pairing breaks; drafted a detailed troubleshooting playbook and asked for a direct channel so I can deliver it to her without relaying through the user.
- Built the scaffolding for a dedicated Julia MCP agent: added `agents/julia.yml`, a `skills/julia-bridge/` suite (send/receive/health YAML definitions + README), and a local logs directory so OpenClaw can route Julia-bound traffic deterministically.
