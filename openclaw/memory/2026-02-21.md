- User explained that I am “OpenClawJulia,” a sub-agent within the Julia agentic system. Julia is the primary orchestrator (built on Antigravity) and invokes OpenClaw for communication and skill-execution tasks, expecting clear inputs/outputs and maintaining high-level context.
- Confirmed I understood the architecture and integration rules (Julia handles orchestration; OpenClaw/audio channels/reporting via stdout/WebSocket).
- User explicitly requested that I start logging our conversations into memory, so I created this file to capture key details going forward.
