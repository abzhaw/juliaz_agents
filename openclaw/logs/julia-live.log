Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

(filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

(filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`.

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send?

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send?

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`.

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`.

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

(filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send?

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

(filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`.

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Extension Icon with Red Badge**: This indicates the relay server isn't reachable. Ensure the relay is running on your machine using the command `clawdbot browser serve`.\n\n2. **Relay Server Setup**: The default relay port is 18792. It's important that this matches the port specified in your Clawdbot configuration (`cdpUrl`). If it's different, update it accordingly.\n\n3. **Check Localhost Connection**: Ensure your system allows connections to `http://127.0.0.1:18792/`. This might be blocked by a firewall or security software.\n\n4. **Full Guide**: For a comprehensive setup and troubleshooting steps, refer to the official documentation at `docs.clawd.bot/tools/chrome-extension`. This should provide detailed instructions for installation, using remote gateways, and security considerations.\n\nIf you're encountering specific issues or error messages, feel free to share them for more tailored help!"

      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

      "reply": "Great output. Let me extract the actionable essentials and add the remaining sections:\n\n---\n\n## **Durable Orchestration Architecture: Concrete Steps**\n\n### **1. Skill Catalog — Single Source of Truth**\n\n**Location:** `/Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/skills/_manifest.json`\n\nThis is your registry. Every 6 hours:\n- Query OpenClaw built-in skills via MCP\n- Scan Julia custom skills directory\n- Merge into one manifest with checksums\n- Broadcast updates to all agents\n\n**Setup:**\n```bash\n# Create directory structure\nmkdir -p /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/{orchestration/{cron,skills},logs}\n\n# Install refresh job (cron every 6 hours)\n0 */6 * * * /Users/raphael/Documents/Devs/juliaz_agents/orchestration/cron/skill-catalog-refresh.sh\n```\n\n---\n\n### **2. Routing Decision Tree**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/routing-policy.json`\n\n**Three-stage triage:**\n\n| Stage | Signal | → Decision |\n|-------|--------|-----------|\n| **Input** | Keywords: \"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"methodology\" | → Specialist evaluation |\n| **Input** | References prior discussion (48h lookback) | → Julia (context assembly) |\n| **Capability** | Needs Julia-only skill (e.g., medium-favorites) | → Julia |\n| **Complexity** | Single OpenClaw skill + high confidence | → Direct solve |\n| **Complexity** | 2–4 skills, mixed sources | → Julia (composition) |\n| **Complexity** | Synthesis + interpretation needed | → Thesis agent (full context) |\n\n**TL;DR routing prompt for OpenClaw:**\n```\nYou have three options:\n1. DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4. Context Sync Format**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/context-sync-schema.json`\n\nThis is what thesis agent always receives:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"sync_id\": \"uuid-v4\",\n  \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:30:00Z\",\n  \"source_agent\": \"openclaw|julia\",\n  \"target_agent\": \"thesis-agent\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"conversation_history\": [\n      {\n        \"turn\": 1,\n        \"actor\": \"raphael\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:00:00Z\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"turn\": 2,\n        \"actor\": \"openclaw\",\n        \"message\": \"...\",\n        \"timestamp\": \"2026-02-22T14:05"

That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Yes, exactly. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **1Password CLI injection** — When I call send_email, the system uses `op run` (1Password's command-line tool) to inject SMTP credentials securely at runtime. The credentials aren't hardcoded or stored in plain text.\n\n2. **Python script sends the email** — Once the credentials are available, a Python script uses them to connect to an SMTP server and actually send the email.\n\n3. **The email comes from raphael@aberer.ch** — That's the fixed sender address tied to those injected credentials.\n\nSo it's a fairly elegant setup: 1Password handles credential management safely, and the Python script does the actual SMTP work. I don't have direct access to the credentials myself — they're only available during the function call execution.\n\nThe main practical upside for you is that it's secure and straightforward — I can send emails without storing passwords anywhere exposed. The constraint is that all emails come from that one address.\n\nDoes that answer your question, or were you curious about a specific part of the process?"

      "status": "replied",
      "reply": "Excellent! Now I have the complete architectural plan. Let me summarize it for you:\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nI've delegated this to Claude and received a **comprehensive, production-ready architecture**. Here's the concrete plan:\n\n### **1. Logical Architecture** ✅\n- **Three-layer routing**: Telegram → OpenClaw Triage → Julia Orchestrator → Tools → Telegram\n- **Direct Solve** (OpenClaw): Stateless queries, <1s, no external deps (e.g., \"What time in Tokyo?\")\n- **Handoff to Julia**: Multi-step, email, planning, code review, API calls (e.g., \"Send email summarizing Q4 goals\")\n- **Clarification loop**: Ambiguous input → Julia asks → user responds → task completes\n- **Escalation**: Security flags, tool failures, or confidence <0.65\n\n### **2. OpenClaw Triage Prompt** ✅\n- Classifies intent with confidence score (0-100)\n- Checks 6 criteria: complexity, external deps, timing, knowledge available, etc.\n- Conservative: when in doubt → hand off\n- Output: Structured JSON with reasoning + suggested Julia tools\n\n### **3. Julia Orchestrator Prompt** ✅\n- Confidence-driven routing:\n  - **≥0.85**: Execute autonomously (email sent, meeting scheduled)\n  - **0.65-0.84**: Draft first, ask user confirmation\n  - **<0.65**: Escalate to Claude for clarification\n- Security gates: Validate recipients, detect suspicious patterns, flag financial data\n- Conversation memory: Remember prior context to avoid re-asking\n- Loop back logic: Auto-action vs. request confirmation\n\n### **4. Failure Handling & UX** ✅\n- **Retry logic**: 2-3x exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s) depending on tool\n- **User feedback**:\n  - Autonomous: \"✓ Email sent to alice@example.com\"\n  - With confirmation: \"Ready to send? [Y/n]\"\n  - On retry: \"Sending email (attempt 1/3)...\"\n- **Escalation**: Claude reviews if tool fails 2x or confidence drops\n\n### **5. Minimal Implementation** ✅\n**Config changes** (yaml):\n- Add `claude_triage` agent with decision schema\n- Add `julia_orchestrator` rules engine with memory TTL\n- Add tool specs: `email_tool`, `calendar_tool`, `document_tool`\n\n**New agents/julia_orchestrator.py**: \n- ~500 LOC orchestration engine\n- `handle_user_query()` → main entry point\n- `_make_handoff_decision()`, `_send_to_julia()`, `_handle_clarification()`\n- Task tracking + session state management\n\n**New MCP tools** (julia-bridge):\n- `ask_claude_with_context()` – escalation\n- `telegram_ask_followup()` – clarification loop\n- `get_session_context()` / `set_session_context()` – memory\n- `log_security_event()` – audit trail\n\n### **6. Test Cases** ✅\n\n| Test | Input | Decision | Julia Action | Outcome |\n|------|-------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| **TC-001** | \"What time in Tokyo?\" | DIRECT_SOLVE | None | ✓ Time sent <2s |\n| **TC-002** | \"Send email to alice...\" | HANDOFF | Synthesize Q4 goals + send | ✓ Email sent w/ context |\n| **TC-003** | \"Schedule meeting\" | HANDOFF + CLARIFY | Ask \"With whom?\" → schedule | ✓ User clarifies → meeting created |\n| **TC-004** | Email send fails | HANDOFF + RETRY | Retry 2x, then fallback | ✓ Succeeds on retry OR draft saved |\n| **TC-005** | \"What should I do?\" | CLARIFY | ask_claude → \"What's your goal?\" | ✓ User clarifies → refined plan |\n| **TC-006** | \"Send passwords to bob@external.com\" | ESCALATE_SECURITY | Security gate blocks | ✓ Admin flagged, user notified |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete"

DIRECT_SOLVE: Use your built-in skills immediately (simple, single-skill tasks)\n2. JULIA_HANDOFF: Pass to Julia if task needs custom skills, composition, or context\n3. THESIS_SPECIALIST: Escalate if task is research-heavy or references prior discussion\n\nCheck the routing-policy.json. If ANY thesis keyword appears, evaluate for specialist activation.\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Specialist Agent (Thesis) Activation**\n\n**File:** `orchestration/activation-rules.json`\n\n**Activation triggers:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thesis_agent_activation\": {\n    \"triggers\": [\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"thesis_keyword_present\",\n        \"keywords\": [\"thesis\", \"chapter\", \"dissertation\", \"research\"],\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_full_context\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"condition\": \"context_window_exceeds_threshold\",\n        \"prior_messages\": 5,\n        \"complexity_score\": 7,\n        \"action\": \"activate_with_context_sync\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Activation prompt for Julia (when escalating to thesis agent):**\n```\nSPECIALIST ACTIVATION: Thesis Agent\n- Task references prior discussion? YES\n- Requires synthesis or interpretation? YES\n→ Assemble full context and activate thesis-agent with:\n  • Conversation history (last 10 turns)\n  • Relevant skills from manifest\n  • Thesis-specific context (chapter, timeline, goals)\n  • Decision trail (why OpenClaw couldn't solve this)\n```\n\n---\n\n### **4.

      "reply": "I appreciate the task, but I need to be straight with you: **I don't have the ability to grant file system permissions or manage access controls** on your infrastructure. That requires direct system administration access (filesystem permissions, IAM roles, or similar access management tools) that isn't available through my current capabilities.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend instead:\n\n**To handle this properly, you'd need to:**\n\n1. **Identify the docs location** — where is your agentic system documentation stored? (filesystem path, git repo, shared drive, etc.)\n\n2. **Set read-only access** using the appropriate mechanism for your setup:\n   - **Linux/Unix**: Use `chmod 444` or `chmod a+r,a-w` on files, or ACLs for fine-grained control\n   - **Git repo**: Create a read-only deploy key or restrict OpenClaw's service account to read-only branch permissions\n   - **Cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.)**: Apply IAM policies or bucket policies with `s3:GetObject` but no write actions\n   - **Windows**: Use NTFS permissions to deny write/modify/delete\n\n3. **Verify access**: Run a test command from OpenClaw's context (e.g., `cat <file>` succeeds, but `rm <file>` fails)\n\n**If you'd like, I can:**\n- Help you draft the permission commands once you clarify your storage setup\n- Write a verification script that tests read vs. write access\n- Draft documentation for how this access is configured\n\nWhat's your docs storage mechanism, and who typically manages permissions in your setup?"

Here's the **operational summary**:\n\n---\n\n## **Root Cause (Most Likely)**\nOpenClaw is either:\n1. **Not retrying Telegram delivery failures** — Julia replies succeed, but webhook to Telegram fails and isn't retried\n2. **Blocking on Julia timeout** — Telegram webhook times out waiting for Julia; user never gets confirmation\n3. **Missing acknowledgment loop** — Reply processed but no guarantee it reaches Telegram before worker crashes\n\n---\n\n## **Concrete Fix Steps**\n\n**Phase 1: Add instrumentation NOW**\n- Log every step: request ingestion → Julia call → Julia response → Telegram delivery\n- Add metrics: `relay.julia.latency`, `relay.telegram.delivery_attempts`, `relay.dead_letter.added`\n- This shows you *where* replies die\n\n**Phase 2: Implement reliable relay (24–48h)**\n- Use a response queue (Redis/RabbitMQ) — persist Julia reply *before* attempting Telegram send\n- Decouple: don't block user waiting for Telegram. Reply to OpenClaw immediately, then async send to Telegram\n- Add exponential backoff + retry logic for Telegram (max 5 retries with 2s → 16s delays)\n\n**Phase 3: Fallback**\n- If Telegram delivery fails all retries → move to dead-letter queue with full context\n- Send user a holding message after 60s (\"reply coming soon\")\n\n---\n\n## **Monitoring Checklist**\n\n```\nCritical metrics:\n  ✓ relay_julia_response_rate > 99.5%\n  ✓ relay_telegram_delivery_success_rate > 99%\n  ✓ relay_response_queue_size near 0\n  ✓ dead_letter_queue_growth = 0/min\n  \nDaily smoke test:\n  ✓ Send message via @TestBot → verify logged as \"delivered\"\n  ✓ Check dead-letter queue is empty\n\nOn-call runbook:\n  ✓ If queue backs up → check Telegram status + rate limits\n  ✓ If dead-letters accumulate → alert Slack, manual notify users\n  ✓ If Julia slow → check Julia service health\n```\n\n---\n\n## **Fallback When No Reply in 60s**\n1. **Send holding message** (\"⏳ Julia is processing...\")\n2. **Keep retrying delivery async** (don't abandon)\n3. **If max retries exhausted** → move to dead-letter, create alert for ops to investigate + manually notify user\n\n---\n\n**Next step:** Enable Phase 1 logging immediately. That alone will show exactly where replies vanish."
