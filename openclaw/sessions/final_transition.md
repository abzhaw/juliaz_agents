# Session Log: Final Transition

**Date**: 2026-02-21
**Participants**: USER, OpenClaw (Transitioning)

## Summary
The system has migrated to **Superpowers**. This session serves as the final log for OpenClaw's context.

## Key Decisions
1.  **Migration**: USER requested full transition to the Superpowers agent system.
2.  **Cleanup**: OpenClaw core files were removed from the root to ensure a clean dev environment.
3.  **Restoration**: USER requested a "Sandboxed" recreation of OpenClaw in `./openclaw_legacy/`.
4.  **Security**: A mandatory gateway (`openclaw-gateway`) was established to enforce "Reason + Approval" for all legacy actions.

## Final Note from OpenClaw (Legacy)
"I remain as a sub-system, observing the new agents system. I will perform no actions without explicit explanation and user consent."
